						<h2>Its a fact:  People don't take <strong>medication</strong> as directed.  This is called non-adherence.  
						<br />
						It is estimated to cost our health care system between $100 and $289 billion each year and over 100,000 deaths (2016 data).</h2>
						<p>There are many factors that lead to non-adherence.  We aim to <strong>solve</strong> some of them by leveraging emerging technology, using data-driven techniques to tackle negative trends as they emerge, and incentivizing all participants to pursue health through adherent medication.  
						<br />
						All nice and good, right?  Maybe an app that tracks medication or something like that?<p><strong>Right</strong>, but wrong.  We're not so naive to think that simply putting something into the hands of patients will be adopted, used, and touted as the fix for all things medical.  Rather, we have deep roots in the health care industry (and the tech industry!) and understand that many factors need to be combined to move the needle on adherence.</p>

Oh, we forgot to mention some other specialties: Medical Malpractice,  Physician Reimbursement readmit expertise, Hospital competitive medicare credits (ugh, and deductions!), and even more through our ever-growing network.

											<h3>Data Gathering</h3>
										</header>
										<p>So much is about the data these days.  That's why we've teamed up with an original Pharmaceutical Process Patent Creator, made certain we can get our hands on the data that others can't.  Why, you say? Healthcare rules are strict about putting patients into fixed verticals.  We step in to coordinate the best care: doctors, pharmacists and pharmacies, hospital systems, urgent care systems, continued care systems, insurance brokers, and so on.  And since we aren't representing any one piece of the industry, we can do things that others cannot - namely: get, sanitize, and present pharmaceutical data.</p>

											<h3>Data Loops</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Perhaps the most important part of this whole endeavor:  we can use analytics, visualizations, and patient feedback in order to improve healthcare.  We can figure out where we, as a system, are stumbling, and begin to correct.  The data will tell us our next move.  As we grow our reach and include more and more patients, more and more physicians, and more and more healthcare systems, we will be building the data that will enable us to predict and achieve a healthier tomorrow.</p>
